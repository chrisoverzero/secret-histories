Since its invention,
pizza has gone from royal meal
eaten at special occasions,
to staple of the hardworking peasant,
to the American cultural icon
that it is today.
But how often
when we sit down for a slice
do we think about the history
of this seemingly simple dish?

It seems as though it's been around forever,
but there was a time
when the world was without pizza.
*Most* of the food of Italy
hundreds of years ago
would be unrecognizable to modern eyes.
After all,
tomatoes were believed to be poisonous
back then,
due to their close relation
to the deadly nightshade plant.
One man,
however,
is painted by history as having seen
the potential in this humble, red fruit.
He saw the culinary possibilities
and depth that could be accessed
by integrating the tomato
into Italian cuisine.
Though…
Only after a rough start.
That man was the personal chef
to the Queen of Italy,
and his name was
Giovanni Pizza.

Culinary historians have been unable
to piece together exactly
the events of that fateful night,
but it is generally accepted
that the first pizza was created
in a blind rage.
Monsignor Pizza was a man
of clearly ill temper --
he was notably unable to keep an apprentice
for any longer than a few weeks.
Queen Isabelle of Italy had made some remarks
to other nobles
at a dinner the previous week
that her chef was starting to lose his touch.
He was an old dog,
she claimed,
and he was unable to learn any new tricks.
(This is a rough translation.
The original Italian statement
was significantly more vulgar.)

That chef decided to take matters
into his decidedly still skilled hands.

He wanted to poison the queen
in a way that would be both subtle and honorable,
as befit a person of her station.
He baked flatbread until it was crispy
and spread mashed tomatoes
not quite to the edge --
those,
of course,
would be the active ingredient.
To give the dish a noble touch,
he delicately laid basil leaves
in a circle atop it.
This proved troublesome,
however,
as the basil leaves would often
fly off of the tomato base
due to the thermal currents
in his walk-in brick oven.

In what would turn out to be his masterstroke,
Monsignor Pizza melted mozzarella cheese
over all the other ingredients.
With the red tomatoes,
the white cheese,
and the green basil,
he had created a dish representative of the <i lang="it">tricolore</i> --
the flag of Italy that persists to this day.

Given that his name is now attached
to something loved worldwide,
and not reviled as that of an assassin,
it is easy to guess how the presentation
of Pizza's special Flatbread Pie was received.
After only a month, 
Queen Isabelle officially declared
that the dish and the man should share a name,
for both were equal in greatness.
The Pizza family continued to serve
the royal family of Italy
for hundreds of years,
even through bloody usurpations
and other breakings of lineage.

Giovanni was also the first to ladle tomatoes
over pasta,
but generations of Pizzas to come would focus on
continuing to improve their namesake.
The addition of pepperoni was realized
by Giovanni's son Guillome.
Extra cheese, by his grandson.
A woman by the name of Sofía Marcozzi Pizza --
who married into the Pizza family --
was the first to serve cold pizza
the morning after it was prepared.
All of these pizza aspects
that we simply take for granted
were once an amazing culinary revolution.

There were lows among all of these highs,
of course.
Guillome was the first to try vegetables
as a pizza topping,
but instead of the now-common
peppers, onions, or mushrooms,
he used the leaves of the rhubarb plant.
These *are* poisonous,
unlike tomatoes,
and caused the deaths of
over 40 people before the rhubarb
was discovered as the culprit.
This was not enough to besmirch
the name of pizza,
capitalized or otherwise,
as the deaths were officially labelled
"necessary sacrifices in the name of culinary progress"
and also
"probably a bunch of [illegitimately conceived children]
who deserved it anyway."

However,
eight generations after the great Giovanni Pizza,
Mattimeo Pizza officially *went too far*.
For his creation of a so-called "deeply dished" pizza,
the entire Pizza family was chased out of Italy.
Curiously,
Mattimeo was given as harsh a punishment
as his ancestor would have received
if he had succeeded in poisoning the queen --
he was put to death in the public square.

Neighboring Germany readily accepted
the now-displaced Pizza family.
The innovations picked up again quickly,
as Mattimeo's daughter added German sausage
to the Italian pizza.
The topping swept across Europe and even America,
thanks in part
to the high population of Germans in Texas.

But for a brief period
in the deepest throes of World War II,
Germany is where the Pizza family --
now called the Von Pizza family --
has continued to live and work.
The current generation of Von Pizzas
is led by Baron Manfred Von Pizza.
He already has under his belt such developments as
the dessert pizza,
the mango-and-pulled-pork variant 
of his grandfather's Hawaiian pizza,
and that culinary juggernaut,
the pizza *roll*.
(California-style pizza cannot be pinned on him,
Baron Von Pizza frequently insists,
and he does not know where it came from
or why it came to be.)

All of this time and effort,
the toil of generations,
is behind every bite of the
sometimes-soggy,
sometimes-greasy,
but always satisfying food
that we Americans consume 23.5 billion
slices of each year.
Slice carefully,
chew slowly,
savor every bite,
and think of the Von Pizza family
next time you order a pie.
