Before the introduction of <cite>Pong</cite>
in 1975 created the video game industry
as we know it,
America was seized with fervor
for video games' predecessor:
audio games.
Audio games had been around
since their invention by Thomas Edison.
His interactive adventure <cite>Mary Had a Little Lamb</cite>
was received moderately well by critics.
Some praised its deep ability tree
and multiple endings,
while others feared their own words being used against them
and destroyed the review copy in a rage.
It was enough to kickstart production,
however,
and the Edison Audio Game Corporation
set down roots in northern Delaware.

As audio games grew in popularity,
Edison remained the market leader
due to its aggressive courting
of the nation's best radio drama writers.
Among the biggest hits were Alan Calufid's trilogy
of horror blockbusters --
<cite>Where Is My Baby?</cite>,
<cite>Has Anyone Seen My Baby?</cite>,
and <cite>Why Can't I Find My Baby?</cite>.
A sample of the first game's script follows:

<pre>
            BABY
      Waah! Waah! Waah! Waah! Waah!
      Waah! Waah!
            BYSTANDER
      Is that a baby?
            BABY
      Waah! Waah! Waah! Waah! Waah!
      Waah! Waah!
            BYSTANDER 2
      I think it is...
            BABY
      Waah! Waah! Waah! Waah! Waah!
      Waah! Waah!
</pre>

The Edison Audio Game Corporation
was not without its conflicts,
of course.
They frequently butted heads
with the United States government
over violent and sexual content in audio games.
Their solution to this problem
was to open the production of audio games
to any manufacturer,
making the federal government fight this fight
on several fronts,
instead of only one.
This had significant benefits
not only for the health of the company,
but for the health of the entire industry.
By legitimizing those independent recorders
who previously had to operate
on a black market of copyright infringement
or glass-needling
to circumvent Analog Rights Management systems,
the variety of games produced started to match
American demographics much more closely.
Edison's unorthodox corporate strategy
had the intended effect of getting audio games
to be seen as an art form,
rather than as disposable entertainment.
But it had the unintended effect
of moving the world capital of audio game production
to Japan.

The company to move first
after Edison's opening of audio games
was a Japanese playing card manufacturer
called "Nintendo."
Roughly translated,
the name means "leave luck to heaven"
or "luck is for newbs."
Nintendo quickly displayed this boasted work ethic
by purchasing the production rights
to over 30 Japanese audio game franchises --
outright hiring many of the developers --
and converting their legacy playing card presses
into audio game platter pressers
in less than a month.

This Cambrian explosion of diversity
in the audio game market --
as well as diversity in the content creators --
came at the same time as advancements
in the technology.
It was previously the case that high quality
sound effects required a needle drop
from the human player.
A missile would be fired at the enemy base,
and the player would be prompted to move the needle
to offset 124426, for example.
There,
a prerendered cutscene of the base's explosion
would play,
followed by a prompt to move the needle
to the offset for the next level.
Next-generation audio game systems
were able to produce sounds to be played
over the prerendered narration,
though it was typically limited to four channels.
Furthermore,
the generated sounds were limited to
those that could be produced by combinations
of sawtooth waves,
triangle waves,
square waves,
and white noise.
Many later audio games restricted themselves
to this set of options
even after further technological advancements
for reasons of inducing nostalgia.

Another achievement of audio games
was in the advancement of relations with the blind.
The nature of audio games
typically put the blind and vision-impaired
on equal footing with the sighted.
But only *typically.*
A landmark game titled <cite>Attorney of Record: Blind Justice</cite>
was ingeniously designed to simulate
the experience of being
a totally blind defense attorney
in the New York City justice system.
Though the cases
and interpersonal interactions were ridiculously unrealistic --
the game was marketed as a "comedic adventure" --
the controls were so faithful
to being actually blind
that most sighted players
found it nearly impossible
to leave their bedroom dressed for work
in the game's tutorial level.
By contrast, 
those who were totally blind from birth
had no trouble at all with such portions
of the game.
"Speed runs"
(attempts to play through the game as quickly as possible)
of <cite>Blind Justice</cite>
by sighted players were distributed on vinyl
through the mail
as a form of performance comedy.
A sample of one such run follows:

<pre>
Ow.
Ow.
How do I...?
Ow.
Where's the door?!
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
*AAUUGGGHHH!*
</pre>



* * *

Eventually,
they added video.
