They poop in a box,
but we still love them.
They scream for no reason at two in the morning,
but we still love them.
They vomit onto the carpet
and then try to *eat it*,
but we still do our best to love them.
Cats have scratched out a special place in our lives --
if not our very flesh --
but so much about them still remains a mystery.
Many people still do not even know
about the small, two-stroke engine
that cats harbor within their bodies
in order to power their purring.
Or how cats were the inspiration for three sports --
parkour, badminton, and curling.
It's time that we all got a little more familiar
with these common familiars.

The earliest known instance of cat domestication
was approximately 9,500 years ago
on the island of Cyprus.
A wheat farmer by the name of Felikos
was wandering his fields
when he heard a voice low to the ground.
If made the man an offer:
The voice would keep his
fields free of mice and other pests
if Felikos would in turn allow it to keep
a small selection of the creatures.
For their tastiness,
it added.
When the bearer of the voice softly stepped forward,
Felikos was inclined to agree.
This creature had sharpness of tooth and claw,
it had fleetness of foot,
and it was the cutesy-wutesiest
little ball of fluff he had ever seen.
However,
Felikos did not want any of the pests
caught by this "cat" creature,
much less all but a small selection.
The cat was not raised to be a sucker,
it patiently explained,
and it knew that nothing came for free.
It would just go ahead and leave Felikos's
share on his bed from time to time,
and he wouldn't have to worry about it.
To seal the agreement,
Felikos gave the cat
the most valuable of human possessions:
a name.
That name was Mittens.

Cats had a special role
in the lives of the ancient Egyptians --
they were revered as gods.
The best known of these was Bastet.
Revered in her very own city,
Bubastis,
she was praised for her intervention
in matters relating to
fertility,
motherhood,
and washing yourself with your tongue.
Another popular goddess was Nahic,
known among the pantheon
for never being on the correct side of a closed door.
Cats are not gods,
of course,
but this reverential treatment
greatly pleased the Feline Overmind,
which showered blessings upon the Egyptians
for generations.

In the late Middle Ages,
armored cats were used in Europe
as battlefield messengers.
The small size and flexibility made them ideal
for carrying orders and strategies
around the combatants.
A downside to this method,
however,
was that the messages had to be stuffed
into the body of a dead mouse
before the cats would accept them.
All this exposure to mouse blood
by wounded soldiers
is believed to have been a contributing factor
to the outbreak of bubonic plague.

Even as far away as Japan,
cats are known for their associations
with good fortune.
The <i lang="ja-Latn">maneki neko</i>,
or "beckoning cat,"
is a common talisman of Japanese culture
and Korean sushi restaurants
that want you to believe they're Japanese.
Though it is named for its raised hand --
palm forward,
in the Asian style --
beckoning the viewer toward it,
it is often referred to in English
as the "lucky cat"
or the
"you buy this mister it make you rich only ten dollar."
Stories of its origin are myriad,
but the one considered most plausible is this:
During the Edo Period of Japanese history,
a samurai was passing by a Shinto temple
when a cat caught his eye.
The cat slowly lifted a front paw,
beckoning the samurai
to come toward it.
After a moment of hesitation,
he did so --
and before he could take
even a second step,
lightning struck the very spot
where he had stood.
As the smoke cleared,
he could see,
lying in a small patch of blackened earth,
a winning lottery ticket.
The samurai immediately converted to Shintoism
and carved a wooden statue in the cat's honor.

The invention of the internet has caused
in the current era
perhaps a greater increase in the popularity of cats
than at any other time in history.
Every twitch of a whisker
is accompanied by a shutter snap
or an exhortation to be cute
so that it's owner may become trivially famous.
However,
top felijaologists report
that the Feline Overmind is puzzled.
We humans have given cats
the agency to desire hot, processed sandwiches,
but not the agency to acquire them without permission.

It is easy to see where the future of cats lies.
The careful Humanâ€“Feline balance
cannot withstand as unstable a fulcrum
as catnip treats and head scritches.
The scales must tip,
and after a 10,000-year compact,
they will once again tip in favor of the cats.
We will be weighed,
we will be measured,
and we will be found *wanting*.
Cats' sharpness of tooth and claw,
once so valued for human purposes,
will be turned against us.
The reign of man will reach its end.
But this does not mean
that the cats will rise to dominance.
Not so easily
does the feline nature change,
and even the apocalyptic slaughters
will occur between brisk, 18-hour naps.
It is not in themselves to hold cats' destiny,
but in the stars.
Vast spaceships crewed by androids,
each with a pet cat
whose gender may change from time to time.
Perhaps this relationship will last forever,
or perhaps,
after a further 10,000 years,
another purification will be required.
Either way,
we should enjoy the time we have spent
and the time we have left
with our feline friends.
And when we see a pair of eyes
glowing in the dark,
we should not fear.
We should not fear
any more than is necessary.
