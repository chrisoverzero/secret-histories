With the global dominance
of the game that United States Americans call "football,"
it is sometimes easy to forget
that there are games, tools, or other such things
by that name
in smaller, lesser parts of the world.
Parts such as Europe,
or Africa.
This is only a sampling
of what the rest of humanity knows as "football."

* In Saskachewan,
a province of Canada,
a "football" is a hooded sweatshirt 
that zips in the front.
It is common for them to have two front pockets,
one on each side of the zipper.

* Newcomers to the South American nation of Peru
are often surprised to hear natives order a "football"
at their local coffee house.
But they soon learn not to be,
for the word refers to a coffee drink
created by mixing espresso
and sweetened condensed milk in a one-to-one ratio.

* If an attractive French woman ever
whispers into your ear
and offers you a "football,"
run.
Run away from her
as fast as you can.
If an attractive French *man*
ever does the same,
run to wherever he wants
as fast as you can.

* Though the word may be difficult to recognize
through its transliteration,
the Japanese island of Okinawa
is famous for its fields of <i lang="ja-Latn">futtobooru</i>.
This special variety of melon
is harvested in the late summer,
and usually eaten directly from the rind
with a spoon.
The rinds are saved and used to fertilize
the next summer's crop.

* In the field of artificial intelligence,
a "football scenario" is when a robot believes
that it understands humans well enough to imitate one.
No robot has yet been successful,
and any robot discovered to be
"in football"
is destroyed immediately.

* Until the 1960s, "Football" was best known in Mongolia
as the name of one of Gengis Khan's horses.

* Before settling on the title <cite>Let It Be</cite>,
producers of the Beatles' final studio album
considered the title <cite>Get Back</cite>.
The title before that? <cite>Football</cite>.
This title was rejected by the band,
with drummer Ringo Starr commenting,
"It's not really a ball, is it?
Maybe we could call it <cite>Footalbum</cite>."
The title <cite>Footalbum</cite>
was rejected immediately.

* In Australia,
"football" is a slang word
referring to a variety of surfing.
This is not surprising,
as in Australia,
every word is a slang word
referring to a variety of surfing.

* A Russian anti-dandruff shampoo
goes by the name "Football."
For obvious reasons,
neither the product nor its trademark
are recognized in the United States.
Curiously,
its jingle is very well recognized:
♪<i>Do or do not, there is no try! Football!</i>♪

* The etymology is unclear,
but in Tagalog --
one of the official languages of the Phillipines --
the word "football" means "passenger jet."

* You should not be surprised
if you meet a person named Football
when traveling to the former Soviet republic
of Belarus.
After the Iron Curtain fell,
Belarusians commemorated the event
by naming their children after a wide variety
of beloved Western concepts.
Other popular names include
Capitalism,
Speeding,
Casino,
Cheeseburger,
and Tallbustyblonde.

* High schoolers in South Africa
attend a yearly Football:
A dance sponsored by their teachers
for which the girls ask the boys to join them,
instead of the traditional reverse.

* Before their eradication
in the early twenty-first century,
the cannibalistic Korowai tribe of Indonesia
used a tool called a "football"
to aid in the opening of human skulls.
Many such tools survive in Indonesian museums,
and some classical French chefs say
that it is just as well suited
for use on pigs,
and should be welcomed
in the modern kitchen
despite its unwholesome reputation.

* A traditional Finnish food called "football"
consists of fish heads soaked in vinegar,
then buried in glass jars
for approximately nine months.
That the fermentation period
corresponds to the human gestation period
is no coincidence --
Finnish women would bury the jars
upon discovering their pregnancy
and share the questionably delicious treat inside
with their newborn.

* Though many throughout history
have falsely claimed to have located it,
the remains of the lost Persian city Football
have never been found.

* Homemakers in southern Italy
must frequently call an exterminator
in order to rid their home of "footballs."
These tiny insects,
only about twice the size of a flea,
can be a major disease vector
if left unchecked.
Any home with babies or the elderly
should be kept football-free,
and the Italian government provides a modest tax credit
to such households
for this purpose.

* They say that if you "find a penny, pick it up,
and all the day, you'll have good luck."
If you find such a thing in Ireland,
they will call it a "football."
But only if it is heads-*up*.
If it if heads-down,
the term is one that is horrifically
racist and sexist,
but coincidentally rhymes with "football"
in Gaelic.

* Pick up a book.
Flip to the very end.
Observe the blank pages added
in order to fill out the book's final signature.
If you were in Morocco
or some other parts of Northern Africa,
you would say that you were looking at a "football."

* It was not until the end of the story
<cite>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</cite>
that we learn that the Green Knight's axe
is named Football.
This axe makes several further appearances
in the Arthurian canon,
even being present at the Strife of Camlann
in which Arthur and Mordred perished.
The green sash which all Knights of the Round Table
wear after Gawain's survival
is thought to be the origin
of modern Brits' habit of wearing
scarves to rugby matches.

* A little known Spanish sport
ostensibly involves kicking a cow-spotted ball
though goals
guarded by members of an opposing team.
In televised matches,
however,
it often consists of standing around
alternated with faking life-threatening injuries
while members of the crowd
threaten each other with violence.
It will come as no surprise
that the name of this sport is "football."
