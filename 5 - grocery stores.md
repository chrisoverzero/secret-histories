Before the creation of the grocery store,
feeding your family was very different
from how it is today.
In earlier times,
hunting was the primary means
of acquiring food.
After that,
it became significantly more *convenient*
with the invention of,
of course,
the general store.

But Americans cried out for *more*.
Despite their love affair with automobiles --
a love affair that was only strengthened
with the construction
of the Eisenhower Interstate highway system --
general stores were looked at with disdain.
Though they are typically limited today
to fast food restaurants
and certain liquor stores,
all stores were once fitted
with drive-through windows.
These windows were the only means of
purchasing from these stores.
There was no concept of "shopping,"
only pulling up and giving your order.
The goods would be loaded
into the trunk of your car in a blind panic,
and the next car would be encouraged to advance
as quickly as possible.
The process involved little stopping.

It was not until the late 1960s
that a World War 2 veteran
and door-to-door vacuum salesman
named Michael Hobson
invented a method by which
customers could both stop *and* shop.
It was a method that he put into play
in eponymous stores.

He explained in a 1987 interview:

> The real innovation,
> I think,
> was the stopping.
> See,
> people always try to give me credit
> for the shopping.
> But there were already experimental "shoppes"
> in Europe
> that my cousin had told me about.
> These gaudy things lining the Paris streets,
> full of people walking around
> and looking for pantyhose or snails
> or whatever [<i class="note">expletive</i>] French people buy.
> No,
> it was the stopping.
> That's what people liked.
> And that's what let us have
> such a wide variety of items.

The "wide variety" that Mr. Hobson mentioned
was a very specific number.
The first Stop and Shops
were laid out with machine-like precision,
despite being assembled entirely by hand
and constructed solely of maple wood.
Each of twelve aisles
was divided into twelve areas
of a single item each,
in extremely high quantities.
Having a dozen dozen items --
or a "gross" --
gave Stop and Shop a massive advantage
over competing general stores and convenience stores.
Because of this variety,
they came to be called "grossery stores."
The spelling would migrate
as the years passed,
but the name stayed the same.

Despite the convenience of stopping,
customers' cars were still a concern
for Mr. Hobson:

> It was
> an adjunct to your car.
> Like a dinghy is
> to an ocean liner,
> a secondary thing.
> So we called it a Car+.
> We had those signs everywhere
> so people would take them
> and put them back when they were done.
> We were a lot more successful

> I couldn't ever get people

> It's a Car+,
> not a cart!
> I lost my damn trademark
> because people got that wrong --
> 
> [<i class="note">inaudible audience remark</i>]
> 
> Huh?
> 
> [<i class="note">inaudible</i>] already a word [<i class="note">inaudible</i>]
> 
> Yes,
> I know that word.
> I went to proper schools.
> But they're completely different!
> A "cart" --
> you know,
> those things back in medieval times --
> those are *pulled*.
> They have a horse in the front
> that [<i class="note">expletive</i>] into a bag.
> A Car+ is pushed.
> And none of my customers [<i class="note">expletive</i>] into bags!

Carts were an essential part
of the operation of grocery stores
for the first decade of their existence.
Competitors such as
Stop and Save,
Stay a While and Shop,
and Please Take All the Time You Need To Purchase
failed to see the necessity
of such things.
Their profit margins were drastically diminished
by purchasing enough land for
customers to drive their cars
up and down twelve different aisles.
The lines for the cash registers
at such stores
were discounted from traffic jam
statistics after only two years
of operation.
This skew in the numbers is a leading cause
of the 1973 oil crisis
in the United States.

All was not perfect
at Stop and Shop,
either.
It was still to be several years
before the parking lot was invented,
so customers would pull over
to the side of the road,
abandon their vehicles,
and walk to the front door
of the store,
rather than risk missing a single item.
Adding the convenience of parking
to the convenience of shopping
created a combination
that disrupted the marketplace.
A huge number and variety
of pre-grocery food stores
were put out of business,
and grocery stores
make up a significant portion
of the American and European
gross domestic products
to this day.

However, Mr. Hobson resisted
changing the name:

> Eh,
> you know,
> I think I got letters every week
> telling me that I should call it
> the Park and Shop.
> One or two of them
> might have been from board members,
> too!
> But I figured it was close enough.
> It was a matter of pride,
> maybe,
> as well.
> All my competitors,
> they were naming their stores
> after themselves.
> George Shaw,
> Arthur DeMoulas,
> Clarence Wiggly...
> As if any customer cared
> what [<i class="note">expletive</i>] actually owned the place.
> I didn't go around calling them Hobson's,
> and I was going to keep them
> exactly as they were.

Even at the time of this interview,
that attitude was a difficult one
to justify.
The company Amazon
(originally Cadabra)
was making a splash in the press
and in the public
with its strategy of selling books
over the internet.
What few non-grocery food stores
remained in the United States
were beginning to turn
to the internet as well,
in order to create a customer experience
that out-convenienced the "grocery" model.
Shopping had gone out of style.

> I don't think these internet stores
> are going to work for food,
> and it's the problem of keeping
> things fresh
> that will make it fail.
> Though...
> If you really want to know the future...
> I have discovered a truly marvelous
> method for keeping food fresh forever.
> You could sell food by mail-order if you wanted!
> I haven't told anyone yet,
> and I haven't written it down,
> but it's simple enough that I'm going to take
> the market --

Mr. Hobson never completed these remarks,
as he died of a heart attack
in the middle of the interview.
