Alcatraz.
The name alone would have
a permanent place
in American popular culture
even if it had not appeared in hundreds
of movies,
television episodes,
and stand-up comedy specials.
But there is much more to Alcatraz
than just a memorable name,
and not all of it is widely known.

The island of Alcatraz was feared
by the pre-Columbian natives
of the area we now call San Francisco.
It was given the name "Evil Island,"
which in their language is "Th'rok."
The natives' avoidance of Evil Island was adopted
by Spanish settlers of the area,
who put up no more than a few small dwellings
and <i lang="es">siesta</i> huts on its surface.
They called the island "Alcatraz,"
from the large number of pelicans
that nested there.
(Indeed, all words in Pelicanese
end with the letter <i>z</i>.)

Used as a military prison
during the Civil and Spanish–American wars,
it was not until 1933 that Alcatraz Island
fulfilled its true potential as a prison island
with the establishment of the
United States Alcatraz Federal Penetentiary.
It would constantly be at the forefront
of incarcerological developments and technology.
For example, Alcatraz was
the first prison in America
to apply the electric chair
as a method of execution.
This gained it the nickname "Murder Island"
from throngs of protesters
among the local San Franciscans.
Those protests were the primary inspiration
for the John Grisham courtroom drama novel
<cite>In Defense of Murder Island</cite>,
though the prison island in the novel
was highly fictionalized.

Dozens of smaller innovations worked together
to give Alcatraz the reputation of being escape-proof,
an appellation not seriously applied
to any other prison on the North American continent.
Though many have tried,
no prisoner
or group of prisoners
has ever managed to escape from it.
The biographies of guards stationed there
have recently revealed the lengths
to which the staff would go
in order to give prisoners
the *belief* that escape was possible.
On a number of occasions,
attempted escapees would be subjected to
fake days on the lam,
fake violent capture,
fake trials and sentencing,
and fake re-incarceration,
all without ever actually leaving the complex.

On behalf of those prisoners,
a suit was filed against the federal government
claiming that this violated
the rights enumerated by the eighth amendment
to the Constitution,
specifically the proscription
against cruel and unusual punishment.
This suit was rejected by the Supreme Court,
with the majority opinion stating
that the punishment
could be considered cruel
*or* it could be considered unusual.
Since it was not considered cruel *and* unusual,
no rights were violated.
(For further details on the suit,
see the book
<cite>Double Fantasy: The Prison Too Far</cite>
by John Bowers.)

In March of 1963,
Alcatraz was ordered to be shut down
as a federal penetentiary,
with rising costs as the stated motivation.
Historians view this act in two ways:
One is as a potential reason
for the assassination of President Kennedy
(though some historians view *any* act
by the Kennedy administration in this way),
and the other is as a cover-up
for Alcatraz's transition into a secret prison.
The former is nonsense,
but the latter is more true than false.
In what was called "Operation Tea Party,"
federal contractors disguised themselves
as Native Americans
and spent the next nineteen months removing
all quartz from the island's sands and rocks
to act as fuel for an interference generator.
Nine days later,
the generator was fully powered.
Alcatraz was free to continue acting as a prison
while having the appearance
of no longer being in use.
This appearance was cemented in 1986
with the island's dedication to the public
as a National Historic Landmark,
while simultaneously dedicated in secret
as a prison for government dissenters.

Probably the most important event
in the history of Alcatraz –
but also the least commonly known –
occurred in October of 1994.
An accident involving an electric chair
with a faulty voltage regulator,
a three-ounce lump of quartz crystal
secreted in a guard's pocket,
and a poorly timed lightning storm
opened a glowing, purple portal
in the chest of Henry Bailly,
the prisoner who was to be executed that evening.
Science at the time had no name
for such a thing,
but we now know it as a "wormhole."
Through this wormhole,
the warden of Alcatraz made contact
with Zartacla,
a federal penetentiary
from an alternate version of Earth
on which being a criminal is good,
and being good is criminal.
The United States government
quickly took over communications,
and began negotiations with their counterparts,
the result of which was
a landmark, cross-dimensional treaty.

A percentage of prisoners are exchanged annually
from this world to that of Zartacla
during the six-day period
between Christmas and the end of the year.
The exact number is determined
on the first day of this "Twilight Week"
for its impact on the following year's crime statistics.
This,
rather than the popularly theorized reasons
of unleaded gasoline usage
or access to legalized abortion,
is responsible for the drop
in the US violent crime rate
that began in the mid-1990s.

Nowadays,
the island's use as a prison
for political dissenters has expanded
far, far beyond the original plans.
The political climate has necessitated
an expansion of the boundaries of Alcatraz itself.
It is possible –
based on careful reading of the Patriot Act –
that the entire landmass of the contiguous 48 states
is now considered an adjunct to the Secret Penetentiary.
Your boss,
your neighbor,
even the woman who runs
the sandwich shop down the street
could be,
in actuality,
a prisoner of the United States government.

But not you.

You'd know
if you were a prisoner.

Right?
