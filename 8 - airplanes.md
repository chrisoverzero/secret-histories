Ever since humanity first left their caves
and gazed up at the blue sky,
white clouds,
and soaring birds above them,
it has been their dream to fly.
It is,
in fact,
humanity's third-oldest dream.
The first two involved having
things to eat
or have sex with.
But while those dreams
were conquered early on
with the developments
of agriculture and alcohol,
flight seemed to remain
just out of reach for thousands of years.
Gliders and hotly aired balloons
only served to remind us
how far we had left to go,
as though the sky itself
were teasing us.
It took until the year designated 1903
for the men known to history as the Wright Brothers --
Orville, Wilbur, and Terrance Wright --
to achieve true
controlled, powered, sustained, heavier-than-air flight.

The Wright Brothers were bicycle repairmen
by trade,
and had keen mechanical eyes from a young age.
This statement is only five-sixths literally true,
as Orville and Terrance each lost both eyes
in a horrible bicycle repair accident
in their childhood home of Ohio.
Wilbur sacrificed only one eye
in order to save his brothers
from the demon that emerged.
Inspired by this incident
(and also banished from Ohio
by the Council of Buckeyes),
the brothers moved their
repair shop to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.
Specifically,
near the region called the Kill Devil Hills.

As their bicycle proficiency grew,
the brothers sought increasingly larger
and more challenging problems to solve.
They started a unicycle-to-bicycle conversion service,
though the opposite proved significantly more popular.
They sold --
but failed to market properly --
a bicycle with backwards gears
for believers in that old superstition
about riding bicycles in graveyards.
They even invented and received a patent
for the process of converting a girls' bicycle
into a boys' bicycle
by means of attaching a broom handle to the frame.

None of this was satisfactory,
and as the twentieth century dawned,
the Wright Brothers' aspirations turned upwards.
They applied a characteristically methodical approach
to what they referred to among themselves
as "the flying problem."
History sometimes neglects to note
the Wright Brothers' failed attempts at powered flight.
They were few,
but significant.
Initially,
the brothers explored some ways
of going around the problem altogether.
The first was a low-weight bicycle frame --
apocryphally made from bamboo,
but there is no record of their ever receiving
shipments from China --
with hundreds of small birds taped to the pedaler.
The notes on this failure
record the first usage of the phrase
"power-to-weight ratio" in human history.
After Orville's wounds had healed,
a follow-up attempt was made
with a single, large bird.
This was a failure for
almost exactly the same reason.
Notes on this attempt blame Orville
for being unable to keep the bicycle upright,
thus constantly flipping the bird.
Orville's rubuttal and gesture
are the first recorded usage of the phrase
"flip the bird" in that context
in human history.
(It should be noted for accuracy
that Orville's exact comment was
"How about you flip *this* bird, Terrance?!")

In the end,
the standard fixed-wing configuration won out.
The brothers built hundreds of gliders
at various scales
to gather aeronautical data,
ranging in size from approximately that of a penny
to one glider that would have required
a person 11 feet in height to control properly,
if that person were somehow light enough
to be carried.
That pilot control was at the forefront
of their concerns,
after the "bird incidents,"
as Orville was inclined to call them.
Each of these models was tested
in a homemade wind tunnel
of the brothers' own devising
not only for the aerodynamic data,
but also for the pilotodynamic data.

It was not until field testing
that the project was struck with trouble
in earnest.
None of the data from the wind tunnel tests,
nor the calculations made from them,
seemed to apply in the real world.
The frame was not light enough,
the engine was not powerful enough,
and the fluid dynamics of air were neither
fluidic enough nor dynamic enough.
The Wright Flyer
(optimistically named <i>Flyer I</i>)
would not soar majestically over the Kill Devil Hills,
but only plop un-majestically
into the pile of featherbeds
that the brothers had set up for safety
and the occasional nap.
Wilbur began to believe
that science was failing them.
He began to believe
that *other means* were necessary.

It probably did not take much convincing
for Orville to go along with the plan.
He had nursed a deep grudge
against Terrance
since the bird incidents,
and wrote privately of wishing to
"send Terrance back to Ohio."
These quotes are present in Orville's diary,
but the meaning of this euphemism is unknown.
Whatever Orville's original plan,
when he and Wilbur decided to
murder their brother Terrance
and use a portion of his soul
to power their flying machine,
their plan was successful.
Wilbur sacrificed his remaining fleshy eye
in the Bernoulli Ceremony,
binding Terrance's soul
to a spot of his own blood
on the flyer's frame.
The <i>Flyer I</i> made four successful flights
on December 17, 1903,
in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.
History would record that it was piloted
twice by each of the brothers,
but it was,
in a way,
piloted by Terrance every time.

When asked to justify their achievement scientifically,
Orville and Wilbur,
thinking fast,
ascribed it to a scientific principle
they called "Bernoulli's Principle,"
after the necromancer
whose work they had borrowed.
It stated that as a fluid's flow speed increased,
the pressure that the fluid exerted decreased.
This is,
of course,
scientific nonsense.
But it served perfectly well
as a cover story
that has lasted to this day.
All powered flying machines --
airplanes, helicopters, and the like --
have a single drop of Terrance Wright's blood
painted somewhere on the frame.
It is painted somewhere *safe* on the frame,
for it must never be removed, lost, or scrubbed out.
If the machine's binding to the soul
of the third Wright Brother is ever lost,
it will never fly again.
