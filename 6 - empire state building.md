* The Empire State Building was a gift from France in 1931, as a follow-up to their gift of the Statue of Liberty in 1886. It was considered a bit of an apology from the French people for their having chosen a statue material that turned an unsightly green when exposed to America's low-density oxygen generators. Though the building was in name a gift to the United States as a whole, the French got to choose in what state it would be placed. It was very nearly given to New Hampsire, as their motto of "Live Free, Then Die" was well admired by France's president at the time, Pierre-Paul-Henri-Gaston Doumergue. Doumergue's eventual decision to place the building in New York was regarded by the people of both France and the United States as a strong one, as New York had been known since it founding as the "Empire State."
* Over the course of its existence, the Empire State Building has been known by a variety of nicknames, such as "Empy," "Statey," and "Buildy." All of these were provided by nicknamesmith Percival J. Johnson, then of Albany, New York. Mr. Johnson is best known today for having given the nickname "Floaty the Boaty" to the <i>Titanic</i>, though that nickname was struck from the offical record after her tragic sinking for having been innacurate. (The <i>Titanic</i> was in fact a *ship*, not a boat.) He was the United States Nickname Laureate for the entirety of the Hoover administration, and for the first two terms of the Roosevelt administration thereafter. He attended the building's presentation ceremony as a guest of President Hoover, and was struck to create the nicknames while being dangled from the safety rail of the highest observation deck by the Secret Service. History does not record whether this was at the President's request.
* It is commonly reported that the Empire State Building is 1,454 feet tall with 102 floors and 1,860 steps, making it the 24th-tallest building in the world at the time of this publication. But that is only if you measure from ground level. Measured from sea level, Mount Everest in the Himalayas is the tallest mountain in the world. However, if you consider "height" to be a measurement from base to summit, then Mauna Kea in Hawaii becomes the tallest mountain in the world. Similarly, when measured from its true base to the top of its lightning rod, the Empire State Building is 20,927,204 feet tall. This makes it the tallest building in the world -- stunting Willis Tower in Chicago, towering over Taipei 101 in Taipei, and dwarfing Burj Kalifa, located in Omaha, Nebraska.
* In April of 1986, the apprehension of Thomas Miller by the NYPD brought to an end a reign of discomfort that had swept the city for eight months. Mr. Miller had received the nickname "Copperhead" from the New York Post for his series of criminal pranks involving dropping pennies from the highest observation deck of the Empire State Building. He later admitted under police interrogation that his intention had been to kill the people passing below. He did not know that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building will never go fast enough to pierce a human skull. This is due to relativistic effects, what Einstein called "frame-dragging." The mass of the Empire State Building, due to its great height, is enough to distort the fabric of space-time around it. For an object not to hit the side of the building on the way down, it must expend energy against the perpendicular gravitational gradient. The overall effect is like climbing uphill, and is so strong that the penny, when it hits the ground, is worth only five-sixths of a cent.
* The Empire State Building is famous among fitness-minded citizens of New York City for not having any elevators. Because of this, it is often used as a proving ground or destructive testing gauntlet by athletic shoe manufacturers. This is memorialized by displaying three bronzed pairs of sneakers in the building's lobby. One is a first generation pair of Nike Air Jordans, autographed by Michael Jordan. The second is a pair of Converse All-Stars, this pair having been hand-sewn by Chuck Taylor himself. Last is a pair of Vibram Fivefingers, those shoes with the toes that are worn by eccentric billionaire CEOs and other socially maladjusted people. They were not signed by anyone, and no one has stepped forth to claim ownership of the shoes.
* The zeppelin docking station at the top of the Empire State Building remains to this day the most frequented zeppelin docking station on the North American continent. Since the successful voyage of the LZ 129 <i>Hindenburg</i> in May of 1937, rigid airship--based travel swept the United States. It maintained a contentious relationship with fixed-wing--based travel, one that swung from bitter rivalry to outright friendship based on economic climates. It was not until the popularity of supersonic aircraft travel grew that the zeppelins began to be grounded. Due to their low expenses -- thus, high profit margins -- it is unlikely that zeppelin travel will ever disappear entirely. But gone for sure are the days when a young girl could step out onto her front porch and see the gleaming, silver-skinned behemoths defying gravity's edicts and floating gently below a pillow of hydrogen on their way to their destinations. Like the art-deco stylings of the Empire State Building itself, they are a relic of a bygone era.
